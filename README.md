# Landing Page Project

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

# What we built

1- We built a multi-section landing page, dynamically add the content to the page.
2- We built a navigation menu dynamically also. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section.
3- While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.

# languages used to build this project

1- HTML
2- CSS
3- JAVASCRIPT & ECMASCRIPT
